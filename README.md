[The Dance of Software Methodologies](https://medium.com/@AlwaysAyesha/the-dance-of-software-development-methodologies-a4d3b7c1675)

## This article relates varying software development methodologies to dance. More specifically, the extended metaphor relates the Waterfall method to the Waltz, due to the repititve '1,2,3' pattern of the dance, while Agile relates to breakdancing's jerking and freezing. I love this comparison, it's very interesting that the writer could relate an artform to very scientific, methodological practices. It's fascinating how the writer contrasted the different types of methodologies with complete opposite dance forms, yet explained that they all want to reach the same goal, build a succesful product, or in this case, create an entertaining piece of art.

I would of never thought to relate software development methodologies to something in the arts, like dance. It is interesting to see how the topics we recently covered in class could be represented by other, more creative things. Not only do Waterfall/Waltz and Agile/Break Dancing relate in their differences, they both come together to do one thing, create a product.
